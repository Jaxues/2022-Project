# 2022-Project
This is a project made to convert non standard cooking measurements (i.e. cups,ounces, tablespoons, etc) into standard units e.g. Grams or Millitres. 
This was built using Flask,HTML,CSS, SQLite3, and some Javascript. This is my first website I hope it is enjoyable
I've spent about a month building it so It's not exactly a masterpeice but I've managed to polish out all major bugs and accomplish a fair amount. 
Though the project is relatively simple I learned a lot from building it.
